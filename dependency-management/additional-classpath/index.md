# Additional classpath (pro feature)
The additional classpath allows you to load additional jars everytime you
start a shell (shell works included).

It can be managed via the Preferences screen, at the `Additional classpath` item.

Each jar added to your additional classpath will be copied into a private directory (different from your
local repository), so that each time you starts a shell, all jars from this directory will be loaded.
